My running route is a well trodden path so I cannot say what exactly drove me to leave it that grey morning so many years ago. I can only endeavor to describe the ordeal so that it might save another runner the anguish it has caused me. Let me begin with the closing of my apartment door at the age of 26; I can say at this point the mania had not yet overcome me as I still carried a key with which to return. The first mile seemed benign, though I slipped and skittered my way towards the river. What happened next betrays an otherworldly illness which I will not attempt to explain.

When I reached the river I did not stop to turn around as a healthy man might. I instead stopped and stared into an undulating, swollen body of water whose argent surface returned no reflection. My conscious mind told me that to enter and slip below the current would mean death in minutes, not hours. Yet I waded in, feeling an electric numbness anesthetize my skin. I don't believe anyone saw this fruitless rebellion but if they had the last sight would have appeared suicidal. I simply walked until the water filled my nose and mouth, until my eyes stung with the salty runoff and my hair waved gently backwards. I was not done running.

Slowly, arduously, I pushed against the silty bottom and made my way upstream. Past a downtown that hadn't recovered from my generation's first calamity. Past an impoverished city that wants so badly to be more than it is. Past visions of pastoral capitalism and cubicles and parking garages. Through the monolithic locks and dams I blazed a sandy, underwater trail northward because no alternative occurred to me. When the river began to dwindle I found myself at the quiet shores of the headwater, the campgrounds still resting in winter repose before the next idyllic spring.

Still, I ran. Down hastily paved trails on which asphalt blended into the grass. I ran along side the ceaseless highways to the port city of an even colder body of water and did not stop. I cut myself on the jagged ice as I pushed into and through the crystalline water, sinking ever deeper into my second abyss. My first paled in comparison to this fathomless depth, but this time the bottom offered a hard surface. I made good progress here and emerged in only a few weeks in a new country. It has here, on this ancient, basalt shore that I realized my northward trajectory would not provide what I needed, so I turned east.

My body, now sodden, was heavy. I lumbered through the last of the continent pausing only briefly to peer into the worn establishments. They were cosy and inviting, but there was no respite for I was only an interloper and the worst was yet to come. The mild relief from easing back into the icy brine gave way to a terrible resignation at the great journey ahead. I sank, following the contours of the planet across the continental shelf. When this too came to an end and I found myself in a vast and lightless desert. The pressure here stiffened my joints until I could barely move but panic drove me to the opposite inclination; I lost myself here. Blind, stumbling, my mind crumbled in the complete absence of stimuli. When I finally tripped and fell face first into the benthic ooze my first reaction was complete terror; when I found the offending object, a piece of my mind returned. Palpitating, I discerned large cylinder. Hand over hand, I hauled myself along it until, almost imperceptibly, the floor tilted against the slight gravity and light once again pierced the veil.

I released the cable once my vision returned and swam upward. What was left of my clothes had long ago disintegrated and I emerged on that sunbaked coast naked. I could no longer run, but I walked a painful, uneven gate until I recovered. This stage blends together in my mind; I am not sure I can separate the details nor arrange them chronologically. I remember great cities of stone and glass; castles, boats, and mountainous passes that broke my spirit and burned my skin. There is a distinct period of intense, jungle heat and that steamy vapor clung even as I plunged back into that horrid ocean.

A deep depression, both metaphorical and geographical, pervaded me then. Conditions were no different than before, but even in my exhaustion I am aware that it will be an even longer trip. I recede into a corner of my mind and watch. Somehow I am still moving. Relief and deception in the form of seamounts; prismatic corals shelter exotic creatures; disbelief as the continental shelf looms once again. I climb, accelerating. I am picking up speed through the southwest, arms extending, chest pumping, I am finally sprinting. It isn't clear where the finish line is. I look down at my sagging skin and skeletal form; suddenly, the route snaps into place and becomes familiar. I find myself on the loop I once started that winter morning and weep, because I am not sure if I ever really left.
