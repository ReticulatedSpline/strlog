Another roundup of journal entries... all the news that's fit to print.

## strlog updates
I've done some work with the physical strlog server after a mildly interesting outage. During some unrelated housework, it seems, I cut power to the breaker circuit that the machine was running on. The outage itself could have been brief as power was cut for only an hour, but I did not notice this blip so the machine remained offline for over a week. Nothing substantial for a blog with single digit readership, but it was inconvenient timing as it is listed on my resume as a hobbyist project, and I happened to be applying to jobs at the time. Wouldn't it be great, I thought, if the machine was smart enough to restart the tenant processes after an outage?

I considered various scripting options, but it turns out Debian ships with a great choice for this called [systemd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemd). It can monitor processes for you, restart them automatically when they fail, and even has target points at which it can start processes. Instead of launching strlog on boot, when ports and network connectivity might not be established, it can be instructed to wait for these resources to become available.

I've also hardened the server a bit further, as the world wide web can be an unfriendly place. One key piece of this was configuring [fail2ban](https://github.com/fail2ban/fail2ban). This is a delightfully simply tool that watches your log files for untoward behavior. In my case, I am banning IP addresses that request malicious pages. For example, this blog is run entirely off NodeJS, so it is safe to assume anyone requesting a page ending in '.php' is fishing for an exploit. There were a few other constant patterns, like sniffing for Wordpress admin pages, trying to backtrack up the file hierarchy, or requesting a large number of pages in an unhumanly short amount of time.

Lastly, there's now [Pihole](https://pi-hole.net/) instance on the machine too. For those unfamiliar, it works on the [DNS level](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System) -- the bit of the router that converts websites into IPs -- to block ads at the source. It's different from the usual ad-blocker fare because it works on any device connected to the router, not just on a single device. Now even guests can browse the web with fewer ads! Per the Pihole dashboard, that amounts to almost 20% of all web traffic to date! On top of this I'm running [uBlock Origin](https://ublockorigin.com/) and [SponsorBlock](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/sponsorblock/). With this triple-threat of adblocking I rarely see an ad anywhere on the web these days. Google has even gone as far as to disable uBlock Origin on their Chrome browser. The fact that the world's foremost web advertiser has done this gives a hint as to its efficacy. What a great piece of software.

On my desktop computer I've switched to Debian from Canonical's [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/) for a few reasons. Debian is one of those projects that has steadily improved 5% every year for 20 years, and is now a stellar operating system that is as easy to install as Windows, more customizable, and consumes far fewer resources. Some websites report that Ubuntu is "easier to use" or "more user-friendly"... I challenge them to list specifically what makes that so. Debian also respects the user in various was that macOS and Windows do not, privacy not least among them. It also let me try out KDE Plasma, a different graphical desktop environment, which has been a great switch. Technically I could have done this without leaving Ubuntu, but it was a good reason to make the jump. Also, [dozens of reddit posts](https://old.reddit.com/r/cscareers/comments/199akp4/software_engineer_interview_at_canonical/) detail some horrible treatment by Canonical of prospective candidates. Having just gone through this process myself, it made me resent the various bugs I was encountering day to day that much more. More on that below...

## job hunt
At the end of last year I was feeling rather burnt out in my current software job. I could say quite a bit about that, but I will limit it to the following points:

1. Our architecture and processes make getting anything done extremely difficult
2. I was getting nothing but 2-3% salary bumps year over year
3. There was no obvious off-ramp from my current hyper-specialized, long-running project

I had a vision of working somewhere within my city within commuting distance of my house, and so with nothing but proximity and a salary goal of $120,000 in mind I began hunting. Somewhere around September of 2024 I began tracking my application in a spreadsheet which grew into multiple pages... suffice it to say the end of 2024 and beginning of 2025 were not great times to be looking. Furthermore, nearly all jobs in my state are in the suburbs. It's a sad state of affairs, as we ceded the entire downtown zone to office buildings that companies abandonded as soon as it made financial sense to do so. Hard to believe anyone expected anything different. 

Anyway, about 120 applications and 10 interviews later, I recieved an offer from a company extremely similar to my current company that we'll call $directCompetitor. The salary offer was $110,000 with a hard 4 day in-office requirement. Coming from $currentCorp, which was paying $98,000 and still permitted off-the-books remote work, it was *good* but not *great*. I was tired of looking however, so I committed. Before I accepted the offer I brought it to my manager at $currentCorp, fully expecting to be let go at the meeting. To my surprise they offered $115,000 to stay, effective immediately, something $directCompetitor wasn't willing to match. So, what's the end of the story? I'm still in the same old desk, doing the same old work, for 17% more money. It could be worse! 

## running
I'm back on a training plan, targeting a half-marathon in two weeks and my second marathon in June. As usual, I've set borderline impossible goals for myself which have made training quite strenuous. Coupled with a nascent joint injury success is a dubious prospect. However, I've been enjoying the longs runs as of late, and I have to say I am impressed with the state of the modern running shoe. I've been buying backstock of the same model I've run on for years, but broke this streak recently and splurged on a new model. Modern running shoe foam provides a remarkable amount of cushioning, but the shoe is also remarkably lightweight compared to the models of yore I remember using in high school. I also noticed a significant improvement in my times when I tried out a carbon-plate shoe. They're a fascinating development, and one of the only advancements in running technology of my generation. The olympic commitee nearly banned them at Tokyo, but they remain a legal tool for runners.

The second thing I've learned is the importance of fueling. There are a number of options to do this on long runs, but as most runners know it is important to consume some sort of carbohydrate when running longer than ~45 minutes to avoid "the wall", or the point at which your body exhausts the cheap glycogen it preferentially burns as fuel and must dip into less easily converted fuel sources like fats. Some eat candy, some bring liquids, I've found I prefer the "Gu" brand of sugar packets.

## time tracking
I listened to [an interesting episode](https://www.relay.fm/cortex/160) of the [Cortex podcast](https://www.relay.fm/cortex), which features the guy behind the [CGP Grey YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/CGPGrey). On this episode they discussed their favorite phone apps "briefly", in what became a four hour episode. Out of everything they discussed I left with only one takeaway, which was the idea time tracking. The concept is pretty simple, and just consists of measuring where you're spending your time, with the optional of goal setting added on top. These goals can be either maximum time limits on stuff you think you do too much, or minimum values for stuff you want to do more. 

The first decision you have to make, however, is how exactly to do it. The obvious first tack is to track everything -- every minute of every day, which is how [my chosen iOS app](https://timelines.app/) is intended to be used. It features various 'timelines', which are just timers that can either be paused or ticking up. The basic plan is to have one tracker running all the time, with a weekly report out on goals and totals. After that you can consider what else needs to change to accomodate your goals. After a few months, though, I was starting to find this exhausting. I was frequently backtracking to correct the record, add missing timeline switches, and adjusting time values. Now I only track stuff pertinent to my goals of language learning, deep-focus work, personal projects and meditation. I dropped all other timelines, which used to include exercise, meetings, measure, hygiene, sleep, family time, transit, food prep and eating, and housekeeping. I chose these because they were broad enough to encompass my entire life, but I decided these did not have as much value as they are all either not optional, not difficult, or not something I sought to change.

Ok, end of post. I'll try to find some sort of coherent theme for the next one.
