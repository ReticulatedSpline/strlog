I'm a programmer, urbanist, and language enthusiast living in a midsized city in the midwestern United States. I created this blog and the software serving it as something between a journal and a programming project in 2020.

Since then, strlog has served as dumping ground for whatever I need to get out of my head. Most posts fall under the topics of technology, politics, and media. You can send kudos, high paying job offers, and virtual cash money to my email below.
