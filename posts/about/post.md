Hi, my name is Ben. I created this blog and the software that runs it as something between a personal journal and a programming side project in 2020. Since then, strlog has filled the void left in my life when I quit the majority of social media and has since served as dumping ground for whatever thoughts, opinions, and rants that pop into my head.
