He watched a single dust mote float downwards, occasionally buffeted by an unseen draft but ultimately and unarguably sinking. He again considered going home, but there was barely time and the rift between them was unrepairable. Besides, things were quiet here and he appreciated the solitude. The only interruptions were the ragged drifters passing through to silently grab supplies. He politely informed them that the pumps that they were dry. Most said nothing or muttered only a quiet thank you. He sat behind the counter, but wasn't even his shop. It was simply a refuge, or perhaps purgatory.

The muted tube TV in the corner featured a floating head discussing the waves of crime rippling through cities. The subtitles below were riddled with errors. Was someone still typing them out? He couldn't see why it mattered. Each medium, whether it be radio, TV, or internet featured a new exercise in futility. Respectable outlets were ostensibly bound by professionalism to play on until the end, speculating on the reasoning, strategies, or simply reporting on schemes of nations to shelter their heads of state. The less salubrious outlets were lambasting the head of NASA for an oversight beyond human comprehension or outright denying what was coming. Since global consensus was reached ten days ago most channels were reduced to glorified countdowns. 

None of it mattered. Momentum does not ask for permission and it does not exist on faith. He was strong enough to internalize the numbers coming out of the world's institutions and come to the obvious conclusion.

The mote of dust finally settled, signifying the end of ad-hoc meditation session. It was not Theravada or Zen but something new -- he grinned slightly trying to create a portmanteau for his novel school of meditation. Through the grimy, dust-stained windows he glimpsed a flicker of movement, something past the desiccated vines still clinging to the station walls. Almost returned to his meditative state, he watched a small hatchback park neatly in front of a pump and a woman, perhaps college age, untangle herself from strewn clutter in the car and lock the door behind her. The sharp chime of the bell of the door broke the revery.

She walked directly to the counter, making eye contact, and slapped a twenty dollar bill on the table. The ease and weightlessness with which she walked betrayed an innocence he hadn't seen in weeks. He cocked his head slightly at this.

"Pump six please." <br>
"The tank is dry." He answered too quickly and the words sounded like a reprimand. <br>

An awkward silence settled on the pair.

    "Say, where are you coming from?"

She looked up and launched into an exuberant description of backpacking in the rockies for the last two weeks. The bemused look spreading across his face slowed her down.

    "I'm supposed to meet my mom in Denver tomorrow. Is something wrong? You and everyone else I've talked to since leaving the back country has been acting strange."

He looked away, suddenly ashamed. With his left hand he shut off the TV in the corner.
    "It's just that the store is permanently closing. To be honest, I haven't been charging anyone today because I'd rather the food in here get eaten than spoil. Can I get you anything else?"

She brightened at this. Five minutes later she was seated at one of two stools facing out through the yellowed window. Between bites of stale hotdog and chips she continued to explain the correct technique for crossing snowy terrain in the mountains.

"You know," he said, "there aren't many like you anymore." <br>

"Because I went camping alone? You sound like my mom. Speaking of, I should really figure out how I'm going to get to the next gas station. The Subaru is just about empty." She took another bite, brows furrowed. <br><br>

He paused. Denver was a 16 hour drive from here. There wasn't time. It would be a pointless suffering. His mind was racing. He wanted there to be another way, but he knew there wasn't. He went back behind the counter.

"You know, I think there might still be a full gas can laying around somewhere. Normally it's for people who run out of gas on the freeway, but I'll take a look." She rebounded into the cheerful figure that had first crossed his threshold. "Oh, you're a lifesaver!" <br><br>

There's no sense in a pointless suffering, he thought again. Below the cigarettes and over the magazines, the previous owner kept a lockbox. He found the key on the first day and opened it out of idle curiosity. Inside was a sleek, heavy revolver. Back when he still felt acute fear he had checked the chamber and knew it was loaded. He shuffled some items around behind the desk to cloak the sound of the hammer. He walked back behind her.

"You know, your mom is going to be really glad to see you."
She didn't turn around, mouth still full of chips, but she nodded vigorously. He lifted the revolver and centered it on the back of her head, smiling as he pulled the trigger.
