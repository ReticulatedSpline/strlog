The code and content of this blog are hosted on [github](https://github.com/ReticulatedSpline/blog). So far, it consists mostly of a partial Markdown parser (a sane person would have used a library) and a web server. The code is written on the [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) platform, with technical inspiration from this [sitepoint article](https://www.sitepoint.com/build-microblog-node-js-git-markdown/) and aesthetic inspiration from John Gruber's [daring fireball](https://daringfireball.net/) website. It was originally hosted on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) and given a name through [Google Domains](https://domains.google/). It may or may not be live at [strlog.net](http://www.strlog.net).
