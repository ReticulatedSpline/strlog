On Wednesday, January 7th, a fascist [executed a completely lawful citizen](https://www.startribune.com/what-we-know-as-questions-grow-about-the-fatal-ice-shooting-in-minneapolis/601559966) of the United States named [Renee Good](https://www.startribune.com/she-was-an-amazing-human-being-mother-identifies-woman-shot-killed-by-ice-agent/601559922) in the street and in broad daylight at the intersection of [East 34th and Portland](https://maps.app.goo.gl/cwNshwKevMtWTaUB8) in Minneapolis. She was a wife, a mother, and my neighbor. The perpetrator's name is [Jonathon Ross](https://www.startribune.com/ice-agent-who-fatally-shot-woman-in-minneapolis-is-identified/601560214). May he hang.

Since then, an increasingly and embolded fascist machinery has been installing itself in our city, primarily in the federal territory of Fort Snelling at the [Whipple federal building](https://maps.app.goo.gl/kExCzqtNYYdQ7KZ5A) and flying into MSP. This extrajudicial execution was preceeded by weeks of illegal state violence, kidnappings, and disappearances and the situation here has reached a critical point. Here are some ways folks local to the metro can get involved, *in order of increasing visibility and danger to yourself:*

1. Attend a constitutional observer training hosted by [Monarcha](https://monarcamn.org/) or [MIRAC](https://www.miracmn.com/).
2. Attend passive protests. These will be broadcast via the usual progressive channels such as [Indivisible](https://indivisible.org/), [AFL-CIO](https://mnaflcio.org/), [MIRAC](https://www.miracmn.com/), and [COPAL](https://copalmn.org/). A great way to discover more local groups is to simply ask around at protests. 
3. Report confirmed ICE/CBP/FBI vehicle sightings to the above groups and online databases, such as the [MN ICE Sighting License Plate Submission](https://airtable.com/apprPhYEXiE9svCFc/pagzgcHmtZuMAMvZ1/form). You can crosscheck plates with the [StopICE plate tracker](https://www.stopice.net/platetracker/?about=1).
4. Participate in local ICE watch groups. You will need to discover these by talking to other protestors and your neighbors as they are mostly on private, E2E encrypted applications like Signal.
5. Harass fascists as they attempt kidnappings. You can impede their work in a legal manner by recording their actions, honking car horns, blowing whistles, and getting the word out as fast as possible to your local groups. Note that these are thugs, not officers. Many of them were simply handed a gun and a vest in the last few months. Just because you are acting within your rights does not mean those rights will be respected. Danger of arrest, injury, or death increases with proximity to these individuals as well as with the tension in a situation. Be aware of moving vehicles, agitators, and emotions. Do not bring pets, children, or anything that could be construed as a weapon to these interactions.
6. Physically impede access to the [Whipple federal building](https://maps.app.goo.gl/kExCzqtNYYdQ7KZ5A). This building is easily accessed by taking the [Metro Blue Line](https://www.metrotransit.org/route/blue) from any north station south to the Fort Snelling stop. There are three entrances and exits to this facility all located along Federal Drive.

It is safer to do this with an organized group. Be aware they will meet you with force, gas, less-lethal and fully lethal weaponry. You can expect tear gas, pepper spray, shoving, and general violence. They may attempt to drive vehicles through crowds or run over protestors. 

Be aware that the train can stop running at any time, so you should have a backup exit plan. Do not bring your phone. If you do, turn off location services and put it in airplane mode. Have a plan to take care of loved ones and pets should you find yourself detained or incapacitated. Set red lines for yourself; decide what are you willing and unwilling to confront on a given day and leave if these lines are crossed.
