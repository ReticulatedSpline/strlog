I am happy to say my blog is back online, with a whole host of changes since the [initial setup](https://www.strlog.net/2020-10-01) went live back in 2020. I shut it down somewhere in 2023 due to a mix of boredom and my dismay at Salesforce purchasing (and raising the prices on) my prior SaaS provider, Heroku. This November I decided to get things running again and to do as much of the setup as possible both locally and manually.

Hosting a static website seems a basic task in 2024, but I found the process to be very instructive. Here's a brief rundown of how my data ends up on your computer:

1. I purchased this website name, or Universal Resource Locator (URL), from a registrar.
2. You type www.strlog.net into a web browser.
3. This request is translated into an IP address through the [Domain Name Service](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/what-is-dns/). The DNS process has many steps, but my intervention begins with a DNS provider. I've chosen Cloudflare for this task.
4. Records I've given Cloudflare resolve (transform) the given URL into my external Internet Protocol address (IP address). The web browser issues a request to this address.
5. At this step the web browser has made contact with my Optiplex server, and a response is generated by [nginx](https://nginx.org/en/), a web server program.

Some other configurations were necessary as well:
- My external IP address is updated with Cloudflare by a periodic running background process (a [daemon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daemon_(computing))) on the machine above. This is known as "dynamic DNS". This is necessary because most IP addresses are not fixed like a home address but rather recycled frequently.
- Normally a router would simply reject any incoming requests for security purposes. For this reason I've configured my router to accept these requests.
- Similarly, I also had to explicitly allow these requests on the host machine's [firewall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firewall_(computing)). In this case Linux Mint ships with a firewall called [Uncomplicated Firewall](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UFW).
- Requests are passed not just to an IP but to an IP and port number. You can think of this like a warehouse which has both a street address and many available docks for trucks to ship things to. Simply providing the warehouse would be insufficient. This is further complicated by the fact the certain low-level ports are "privileged" and running [userland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_space_and_kernel_space) programs on them is restricted. For this reason nginx also acts to bridge these low level ports and map them to higher level, unrestricted ports on the machine where the program is actually run.

So, setting up a static blog is an uncomplicated task with many caveats. Doing this work manually lead to a deeper understanding of the technology involved.
