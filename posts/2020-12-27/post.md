I was able to finish up a few titles I had been putting off this week:
- [*A Brief History of Time*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Brief_History_of_Time) by Stephen Hawking; This recapping of modern [cosmology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmology) is probably a little out of date, but is still seems like a good primer. It's a whirlwind tour of physics from a geocentric model, to the expanding universe, to string theory and beyond. I'm not sure how much I actually absorbed, and it's still difficult to really picture what a multiverse or curved spacetime really *means*, but nonetheless it's fun to think about.
- [*Children of God*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children_of_God) (Sequel to *The Sparrow*); I read the first in this series awhile ago and really enjoyed it. The protagonist, a priest, has everything violently taken from him. The end of *The Sparrow* leaves him broken in many ways, but at least functional. This sequel drags the priest back to the planet where he was tortured and tries to provide a reason for his suffering; it's unapologetically spiritual by completing his arc from faith to atheism and back to faith. I appreciated the world building and character development, but the [defense of problem of evil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodicy) fell flat to me, and I found I enjoyed the first two thirds of the series more than the end. Maybe I'm just cynical.
